// This file tests the 'except' constraint functionality.

// --- Test 1: Should compile successfully ---
div {
    except span;
    p { text: "This is allowed."; }
}

// --- Test 2: Should fail to compile (or throw runtime error) ---
// Note: We expect the compiler to fail on this file.
// CTest will still report "passed" if the exit code is 0,
// but we should see a "Constraint violation" error in the output.
